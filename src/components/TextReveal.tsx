With a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, and Data Science, I have worked on academic projects and training programs that helped me gain practical skills in software development and machine learning. My recent project focused on MRI-Based Brain Tumor Detection using CNN and Deep Learning methods, where I applied Python, TensorFlow, and image processing techniques to create a reliable AI-driven diagnostic tool. I am eager to grow as a developer, contribute to impactful projects, and continuously enhance my technical and soft skills.";
